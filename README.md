Trocq is a modular parametricity plugin for Coq. It 
can be used to achieve proof transfer by both translating a user goal into another, related,
variant, and computing a proof that proves the corresponding implication.

The plugin features a hierarchy of structures on relations, whose instances are computed from registered user-defined proof via parametricity. This hierarchy ranges from structure-less relations to an original formulation of type
equivalence. The resulting framework generalizes [raw parametricity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.6336), 
[univalent parametricity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.6336) and
[CoqEAL](https://github.com/coq-community/coqeal), and includes them in a unified framework.

The plugin computes a parametricity translation "Ã  la carte", by performing a fine-grained analysis of the requires properties for a given proof of relatedness. In particular, it is able to prove implications without resorting to full-blown type equivalence, allowing this way to perform
proof transfer without necessarily pulling in the univalence axiom. 

The plugin is implemented in Coq-Elpi and the code of the parametricity translation is fairly close to a pen-and-paper sequent-style presentation.

## Building and installation instructions

Trocq is a still a prototype. In particular, it depends on a [custom version](https://github.com/ecranceMERCE/coq-elpi/tree/strat) of Coq-Elpi.
It is not yet packaged in Opam or Nix.

There are however three ways to experiment with it,
all documented in the [INSTALL.md file](INSTALL.md).

## Documentation

See the [tutorial](artifact-doc/TUTORIAL.md) for concrete use cases.

In short, the plugin provides a tactic:
- `trocq` (without arguments) which attempts to run a translation on
a given goal, using the information provided by the user with the
commands described below.

And three commands:
- `Trocq Use t` to use a translation `t` during the subsequent calls to
the tactic `trocq`.
- `Trocq Register Univalence u` to declare a univalence axiom `u`.
- `Trocq Register Funext fe` to declare a function extensionality axiom `fe`.
